# manage.py test polls looked for tests in the polls application

# it created a special database for the purpose of testing
# it looked for test methods - ones whose names begin with test
# in test_was_published_recently_with_future_question it created a Question 
# instance whose pub_date field is 30 days in the future
# … and using the assertIs() method, it discovered that its was_published_recently()
# returns True, though we wanted it to return False
